# Pancreatic_Cancer_Detection_Using_Machine_Learning
A Flask-based web application for early detection of pancreatic cancer using advanced Machine Learning techniques. The system is trained using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression models, with Random Forest selected as the best-performing model for deployment.

The application provides:

✔️ Cancer risk prediction using trained ML models

✔️ Probability score for better interpretability

✔️ Analysis dashboard with important features

✔️ PDF report generation

✔️ SQLite database for storing prediction history

✔️ Clean UI with multiple pages (Home, Detection, Analysis, About)

✔️ Separate ML model (.pkl) hosted in GitHub Release

🔗 Download ML Model (.pkl)

The trained model file is stored securely under GitHub Releases due to its large size.
